# Signature-Verification-using-Siamese-Network

### Overview
I developed Signature Verification model using Siamese Network and Triplet Loss

### Motivation
Here, I developed Signature Verification model using Siamese Network. Actually, I was learning about One shot Learning using Siamese Network and Triplet Loss, while this instructor gave me an example of FaceNet Model for Face Recognition & Face Verification. After that I got an idea about implementing Signature Verification model.
I started exploring in it and I not got any good repository of it. Then I made changes in Network Architecture of FaceNet Model and implemented with web app for it.
